## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?

1. The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function.
2. An optional name. (Our function's name is sayHello.)
3. A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses. (Our sayHello function doesn't have any parameters.)
4. The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.
5. An optional return statement. (Our sayHello function doesn't have a return statement.)
6. The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- How do you call a function?
  By typing the name of the function followed by an opening parenthesis, any arguments that it takes, and a closing parenthesis.

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  You can think of a parameter as a placeholder. It is basically a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument. When the function's code block is run, the parameter will be holding the value of the argument.
